YOLOv11 (You Only Look Once version 11) is a state-of-the-art deep learning-based object detection algorithm designed for real-time applications. It enhances the speed and accuracy of object detection by employing a single convolutional neural network (CNN) to simultaneously classify objects and predict their bounding boxes. Compared to previous YOLO versions, YOLOv11 introduces several improvements in efficiency, precision, and robustness.
Key Features:
Fully Convolutional Network (FCN): YOLOv11 utilizes deep convolutional layers to extract spatial features from input images, enabling efficient feature representation and object detection.

Anchor Boxes and Multi-Scale Prediction: The model incorporates an advanced anchor box mechanism to detect objects of varying sizes and aspect ratios, improving detection performance, particularly for small objects.

Parallelized Predictions: Unlike traditional object detection algorithms, YOLOv11 performs parallel predictions of multiple bounding boxes and class labels, significantly enhancing inference speed.

Optimized Loss Function: YOLOv11 employs an improved loss function that effectively balances object localization loss, classification loss, and confidence score loss, leading to better detection accuracy.

Efficient Training Strategies: The model supports adaptive training techniques such as transfer learning, data augmentation, and mixed precision training to enhance performance and reduce computational overhead.
